# 🧠 3_UI: Knowledge & Skill Acquisition

- **Premise:** Development is a journey of learning.
- **Content:** A personal knowledge base for concepts, theories, and skills.
- **Conclusion:** Fosters continuous improvement.

## 🎨 The User Interface
In this project, the **UI is the Notebook itself**, representing two perspectives:

### Victim's Perspective
-   **Markdown Cells**: Explain the victim model architecture and API.
-   **Code Cells**: Train and deploy the victim model.
-   **Output**: Show prediction confidences that leak information.

### Attacker's Perspective
-   **Markdown Cells**: Explain the extraction strategy.
-   **Code Cells**: Execute query attacks and train surrogate.
-   **Visualizations**: Compare decision boundaries between victim and surrogate.

The user interacts by running cells sequentially and observing how extraction progresses query by query.
